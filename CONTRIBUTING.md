# Contributing to NV-Tesseract

Thank you for your interest in this project.

## Issues

We track bugs, feature requests, and questions in **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NV-Tesseract/issues)**.

1. **Search first** — Check open and recently closed issues for duplicates before opening a new one.
2. **Security** — Do **not** file security vulnerabilities as public issues. Follow [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) instead.
3. **Choose a clear title** — Summarize the problem or request in a few words (for example, “Forecasting: error when `context_df` has extra columns”).
4. **Describe the context** — In the body, include at least:
   - **Area:** `forecasting`, `ad_diffusion`, or other (for example, `scripts`, `CI`, documentation).
   - **Environment:** OS, Python version, and how you installed the package (`uv`, `pip`, editable install, and which subproject: `forecasting` or `ad_diffusion`).
   - **What you expected** vs **what happened** (for bugs), or **use case and proposed behavior** (for features).
5. **Reproducible bugs** — For defects, add a **minimal** code snippet, sample data (or steps to generate it), and the full error message or traceback. If the issue is version-specific, state the package and dependency versions (for example, from `uv pip freeze` in your environment).
6. **Link from pull requests** — If a change fixes or implements an issue, reference it in the PR description with `Fixes #123` or `Closes #123` (or `Refs #123` for partial work) so the record stays connected.

Maintainers may ask for more detail, a smaller reproducer, or a quick test under a different OS or Python version.

## Licensing

**License for contributions:** This project **only** accepts contributions that you license under the **Apache License, Version 2.0**. Do not submit code under any other license terms (including proprietary, copyleft-only, or incompatible licenses). By opening a pull request or otherwise contributing, you agree that your contributions will be distributed under Apache-2.0 on the same terms as the rest of this repository (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) at the repository root).

That obligation is separate from the **Developer Certificate of Origin** below: every commit must still include a valid `Signed-off-by` line certifying the DCO.

Third-party notices and PyPI dependency summaries are in [`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md). **Verbatim upstream license files** for source included in this repo live under [`third_party/`](third_party/) (see [`third_party/README.md`](third_party/README.md)). Attribution required by the Apache License for redistributed third-party components appears in [`NOTICE`](NOTICE) and in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) under **ADDITIONAL THIRD-PARTY LICENSES**.

### Source file headers

- **NVIDIA-authored** Python files use SPDX short-form tags (`SPDX-FileCopyrightText`, `SPDX-License-Identifier`) per SPDX Specification v2.3, Annex E. Use the copyright attribution **`Copyright (c) <year> NVIDIA CORPORATION & AFFILIATES. All rights reserved.`** (see [`scripts/add_spdx_headers.py`](scripts/add_spdx_headers.py) for the shared template).
- Files that include third-party or modified third-party code must retain **upstream copyright and license notices** in the file (SPDX alone is not a substitute where upstream terms require full notice).

You can refresh SPDX headers on Python trees with:

```bash
make spdx
```

Verify headers before submitting:

```bash
make spdx-check
```

## Intellectual property review (NVIDIA contributors)

If you are contributing as part of your work at NVIDIA, follow your organization’s **IP Review Process for Open Source** (internal documentation on Confluence: *IP Review Process — Open Source*) before submitting changes intended for external release. Ensure your contributions are cleared for distribution under Apache-2.0 and do not incorporate material you are not entitled to license.

External contributors should ensure they have the rights to submit their changes under Apache-2.0 and that third-party code meets the notice requirements above.

## Developer Certificate of Origin

We use the **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)** for contribution approval.

**Link to DCO:** [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)

#### Signing Your Work

- We require that all contributors “sign-off” on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.
  - Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.
- To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```

  This will append the following to your commit message:

  ```text
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
  ```

- Full text of the DCO (<https://developercertificate.org/>):

  ```text

  (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
      of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
      license and I have the right under that license to submit that
      work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
      by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
      permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
      in the file; or
  (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other

  ```

Contributions consisting of commits without a valid sign-off cannot be merged.

## Development workflow

- Install dependencies with **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** per the top-level [`README.md`](README.md).
- Lint and format (Ruff): `make lint` / `make lint-fix` from the repository root.
- Forecasting tests (example): `cd forecasting && uv run pytest sdk/tests`.

Open a pull request against the default branch with a clear description of the change and any relevant issue references.
